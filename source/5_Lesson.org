** Learn It – The Computer - Human Interface
:PROPERTIES:
:HTML_CONTAINER_CLASS: learn
:END:
- The earliest computers relied on their operators typing in commands using a typewriter keyboard interface.
- There are advantages to such an interface, but there are many disadvantages. Try and think of a few?
- When IBM created SQL in 1974 they wanted the language to be robust because of what Databases contain, i.e. people's personal data.
- So IBM's view was to seperate the two parts into the Front end, user interface and the Rear end that contains the Database Engine.
- The front end is independent so as the User Interfaces changes with time (modernisation) it will not impact on the Database itself.
- Consider the progress within computing that has happened since 1974 and how the latest interface (WWW) drives Databases today.

** badge It – User Interfaces
:PROPERTIES:
:HTML_CONTAINER_CLASS: badge
:END:
- Research the different Computer - Human Interfaces (min 3) analysing how each interfaces works and why it was created.
- You must detail the main advantages and disadvantages for each interface in terms of ease of use, complexity and data throughput.
- - Achieve this by using a Text Editor of your choice & submit your evidence on the Bourne to Learn website. 
- Each *Term* will need to be fully explained in your *own words* within a short paragraph, using an example. Remember to use full sentences and connectives (..because, therefore). 

** Try It – Pattern Recognition

- Look at the following 3 number sequences, can you identify the pattern in how they change? Make a note of each!

#+BEGIN_SRC 
Pattern 1:
     1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256

Pattern 2:
     0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34

Pattern 3:
     2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29

- How did you work out the patterns? 
- Was one of them more difficult than the others? 
- When looking for patterns, some of them we can decipher by using *decomposition* (looking at a small subset of numbers) to identify the rules used.
- Others, however, we need to use *abstraction* to focus on the numbers themselves to identify a common theme.

- How we approach a problem makes a huge difference, we need to weigh up the best approach – often this means looking at a large amount of data and picking a particular method to begin.
- Examples include Divide and Conquer or focusing on key details using Abstraction
- Here are some general approaches to a problem: 
  - Understand the problem (Algorithm)
  - Break it down into smaller problems (Decomposition)
  - Focus on important details (Abstraction)
  - Look for similarities (Pattern Recognition)
  - Evaluate your method

** Try It – Problem 2
:PROPERTIES:

:END:
- Assassin is a popular game on college campuses. The game consists of several players trying to eliminate the others by means of squirting them with water pistols in order to be the last survivor. Once hit, the player is out of the game.
- Game play is fair play at all times and all locations, and tends to last several days depending on the number of participants and their stealth. 
- At Bourne Grammar School, 5 teachers participated in a game that only lasted four days. Can you determine each teachers’ name, their team color, their assassin alias, how they were eliminated, and their extra-curricular activity?

| Names:   | Mr Delport, Miss Potts, Mrs Ellis, Mr Fone, Mr Dougall                                                                      |
| Colours: | Red, Green, Blue, Purple, Black                                                                                             |
| Alias:   | Captain Dawn, Night Stalker, Dark Elf, McStealth, Billy                                                                     |
| Capture: | Caught at weekly meeting, Caught helping friend with car trouble, Ambushed during sleep, Caught on the way to class, Winner |
| Club:    | Long Distance Running, Weight Lifting, Flower Arrangement, Ice Skating, Model Trains                                        |

- *MONDAY*: Mr Delport, the girl named Captain Dawn, and the person in purple avoided any action that day. The teacher in charge of Model Trains was able to easily catch Mr Dougall because she already had a meeting with him that day. Since it was a weekly engagement, he didn't suspect a thing. Goodbye red player.

- *TUESDAY*: Everyone tried to get in on the action today. The girl masquerading as the Dark Elf (who was wearing either black or red) and the Ice Skater lived to see another day. The purple player was able to catch the obliging yet naive green player by calling her and pretending he had car trouble.

- *WEDNESDAY*: The weight lifter (who was still "alive") was surprised to hear that the Model Train club owner, who wasn't Miss Potts the flower arranger, ambushed Night Stalker as he slept in his dorm.

- *THURSDAY*: The black player was declared the victor after luckily spotting "Billy" on his way to “Do you even lift?”, a class required for his club.
