<li>The earliest computers relied on their operators typing in commands using a typewriter keyboard interface.</li>
<li>There are advantages to such an interface, but there are many disadvantages. Try and think of a few?</li>
<li>When IBM created SQL in 1974 they wanted the language to be robust because of what Databases contain, i.e. people's personal data.</li>
<li>So IBM's view was to seperate the two parts into the Front end, user interface and the Rear end that contains the Database Engine.</li>
<li>The front end is independent so as the User Interfaces changes with time (modernisation) it will not impact on the Database itself.</li>
<li>Consider the progress within computing that has happened since 1974 and how the latest interface (WWW) drives Databases today.</li>

<li>How did you work out the patterns?</li>
<li>Was one of them more difficult than the others?</li>
<li>When looking for patterns, some of them we can decipher by using <b>decomposition</b> (looking at a small subset of numbers) to identify the rules used.</li>
<li>Others, however, we need to use <b>abstraction</b> to focus on the numbers themselves to identify a common theme.</li>
